GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2025 Ideomind

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended
to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains
free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public
License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its
authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public
Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free
software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that
you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to
surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of
the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must
pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too,
receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the
software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
modify the software.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for
this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions
be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of
previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the
software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible
with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of
such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is
most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice
for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to
extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the
freedoms of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow
patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those
that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it
effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the
program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.


                     GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

    "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

    "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works,
    such as semiconductor masks.

    "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.

    "You" means an individual or legal entity exercising rights under this License who
    has not previously violated the License;"To "protect your rights"
    means protecting the rights of all who receive copies or other covered works from you.

    Words referring to "writing" include correspondence in any form, including
    electronic communication.

1. Source Code.

    The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
    modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

    A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official standard
    defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified
    for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers
    working in that language.

    The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other than the
    work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major
    Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to
    enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard
    Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code
    form. A "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
    (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on
    which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an
    object code interpreter used to run it.

    The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the
    source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the
    object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.
    However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose
    tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in
    performing those activities but which are not part of the work.

2. Basic Permissions.

    All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on
    the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This
    License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified
    Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License
    only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License
    acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by
    copyright law.

3. Protecting Users' Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

    No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure
    under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO
    copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws, and the
    requirements of this License regarding distribution of source code must not be
    interpreted as an exception to such laws.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

    You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it,
    in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on
    each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that
    this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply
    to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give
    any other recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

    You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it
    from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4,
    provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and
    giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this
    License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the
    requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone
    who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along
    with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and
    all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate
    such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate
    Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not
    display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

    You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections
    4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding
    Source under the terms of this License, in one of the following ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a
    physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed
    on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a
    physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at
    least three years and giving the recipient a copy of the Corresponding Source
    on a durable physical medium for a price no more than your reasonable cost of
    physically performing this conveying of source, or

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written
    offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only
    occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code
    with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis
    or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in
    the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require
    recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you take
    steps reasonably calculated to ensure that peers receiving the object code also
    receive access to the Corresponding Source.

    A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the
    Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source.

7. Additional Terms.

    "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by
    making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions
    that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were
    included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable
    law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may
    be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains
    governed by this License without regard to those additional permissions.

    When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any
    additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional
    permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases.) You
    may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
    for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a
    covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that
    material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works
    containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring
    that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as
    different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors;
    or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names,
    trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by
    anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual
    assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these
    contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

    All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
    restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received
    it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this
    License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that
    term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing
    or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed
    by the terms of that license, provided that the further restriction is not in
    conflict with this License.

8. Termination.

    You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided
    under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void,
    and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including
    any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

    However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a
    particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until
    the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b)
    permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by
    some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

    You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy
    of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a
    consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does
    not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you
    permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe
    copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or
    propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do
    so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

    Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a
    license from the original licensors to run, modify and propagate that work
    subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
    third parties with this License.

11. Patents.

    A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of
    the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is
    called the contributor's "contributor version".

    A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or
    controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired,
    that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making,
    using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that
    would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the
    contributor version. For purposes of this definition, "control" includes
    patent licenses that the contributor has the right to grant directly or
    indirectly, including sublicenses, but excludes licenses that the contributor
    does not have the right to grant.

    Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
    license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell,
    offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents
    of its contributor version.

    In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
    agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as
    an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue) applied to
    or by a party.

    If you convey a contributor version, knowingly relying on a patent license,
    and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy,
    free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available
    network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1)
    cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange, in a manner
    consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license
    to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means you have actual knowledge
    that, but for the patent license, your conveying the contributor version in
    such a manner would infringe one or more identifiable patents.

    If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you
    convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a
    patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing
    them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work,
    then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients
    of the covered work and applies to the entire work, if the patent license
    and the conveyance of the covered work are part of a single transaction or
    arrangement.

    If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the
    Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of
    charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available
    network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1)
    cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange, in a manner
    consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license
    to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means you have actual knowledge
    that, but for the patent license, your conveying the contributor version in
    such a manner would infringe one or more identifiable patents.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

    If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse
    you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work
    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any
    other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.

13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to
    link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the
    GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey
    the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the
    part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the Affero
    GPL, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
    combination as such.

14. Revised Versions of this License.

    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
    General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in
    spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
    problems or concerns.

    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies
    that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License "or any later
    version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
    conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published
    by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
    number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever
    published by the Free Software Foundation.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

    THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
    LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.

16. Limitation of Liability.

    IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
    ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE
    PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
    GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE
    OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR
    DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR
    A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH
    HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.


How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to
the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone
can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them
in a file which is commonly used for that purpose, called "COPYING". If it is
not possible to put the notice in a particular source file, put it in the
documentation and accompany the program with a written offer to provide the
source code. The suggested notice is:

  Copyright (C) 2025 Ideomind

  This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
  it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
  the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
  (at your option) any later version.

  This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
  GNU General Public License for more details.

  You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
  along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
